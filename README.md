# ITSPRServer

## Why?

I've developed this project as a hobby during quarantine. The idea came from the fact that I was bored during this period and because my uni website and services are basically trash.

So I've decided to develop this project to test my skill, learn more, help coding community and maybe help my uni improve its services and efficency and make future generations free of all (most) the hassels I've been through.

## What does it do?

All it does is provide a webapp with react to do all the requests.

## What is it made with?

This web is made with:

- Create-React-App
-

## Will it be finished?

Sincerely I don't know, as it is just a hobby project; not a priority. I'll work on it whenever I feel like it, so it may not have many regular updates not commits.
